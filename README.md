## 🔑 Key Insights
- July & August contribute >60% of rainfall, critical for sowing.
- Yield improvements not always aligned with rainfall → irrigation & technology matter.
- Sugarcane, Rice, Wheat are high-yield crops; pulses/oilseeds show volatility.
- Some states underperform despite high rainfall → efficiency gaps.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- **Farmers**: Align sowing with July–August rains; diversify with drought-tolerant crops.  
- **Policymakers**: Invest in irrigation/soil programs; update advisories based on decadal shifts.  
- **Researchers**: Study soil–rainfall interactions; pilot precision farming in volatile regions.
